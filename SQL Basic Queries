Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:




SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
        FROM STATION
        ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY)
        WHERE ROWNUM = 1
UNION
SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY)
WHERE ROWNUM = 1;



Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
    WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(LOWER(CITY), '^[aeiou]') -- ^ checks beg of string
    intersect 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
    WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(LOWER(CITY), '[aeiou]$'); --$ checks end of string
